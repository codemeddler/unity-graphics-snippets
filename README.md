# unity-graphics-snippets
Unity3D Game Graphics Code Snippets for reference use. Used with Unity3D game engine in 2018, so might need some rework.

As code is removed from projects, the code is not usable as is. Code should however give reference on how to code a racing game in Unity.

## NOTE
PostProcessing code is based on https://github.com/KumoKairo/Sleek-Render
